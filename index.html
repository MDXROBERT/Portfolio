            <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated Computer Science student entering my final year at Middlesex University with a focus on achieving a first-class degree. Over the past two years, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bash scripting. Additionally, I possess skills in Cisco networking, GitHub, Azure management, MongoDB database management, and Linux commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of academia, I have gained practical experience through my employment at Amazon, where I have further refined my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. I am actively seeking opportunities for professional growth and am open to job offers as well as engaging in challenging projects that allow me to leverage my expertise in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I lead an active lifestyle. I enjoy activities like gym workouts, table tennis, and badminton, which not only keep me physically fit but also foster teamwork and sportsmanship. In my downtime, I am an avid gamer, fascinated by the immersive worlds and intricate mechanics of video games. I aspire to channel this passion into creating or contributing to the development of my own game someday.

            <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>
            <p>
                
In my spare time, I've been working on various projects to deepen my programming knowledge across different languages. I‚Äôve experimented with game development in Python, creating simple games to understand the basics of game mechanics and logic. Currently, I'm developing a third-person game using Godot, focusing on mastering the engine and grasping the core principles of game design and development.

Additionally, I'm building a website that features a typewriter game and various JavaScript effects and games. This website is not only a showcase of my work but also a project where I'm challenging myself to integrate 3D graphics using the Three.js library in JavaScript. By doing this, I'm learning how to create interactive and visually engaging web experiences.

These projects are part of my ongoing effort to pursue knowledge and improve my skills in programming and game development. I am passionate about continuously expanding my understanding and capabilities in these areas, and these endeavors allow me to apply theoretical concepts in practical, real-world applications.
